## Shake Alarm Clock: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Child Education - Learn to Recognize Something app (Belajar Mengenal Sesuatu)!

This is an open source Flutter app developed by Singgih Suryo Prasetyo. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Flutter user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences, images and sounds) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protected your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Sincerely yours,  
Singgih Suryo Prasetyo.  
Jakarta, Indonesia.
